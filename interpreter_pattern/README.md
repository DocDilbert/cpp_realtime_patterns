# Interpreter-Pattern

## Intent
An interpreter is translating and executing a custom sequence of instructions defined by the programmer. By processing each instruction individually and performing its associated operation in real-time, the interpreter pattern allows for efficient and adaptable execution of user-defined languages.

## Notes
* Normally, an interpreter is used together with a tokenizer. However, this must not necessarily be the case. To keep the examples simple, I have deliberately dispensed with a tokeniser and instead simply defined a token sequence in an array.
