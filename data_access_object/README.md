# Data access object pattern
## Intent
This pattern abstracts access to a data storage from the code that works with the actual data. It is often used in the context of databases. Basically it can be seen as a container that works according to the [CRUD principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). The storage can also be just RAM which i assume here.
