# Data access object pattern
## Intent
This pattern abstracts access to data storage from the code that works with the actual data. It is often used in the context of databases. Basically it can be seen as a container that works according to the [CRUD principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). The storage can also be just RAM which i assume here.
