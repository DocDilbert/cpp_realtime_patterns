# Interpreter 

## Intent
An interpreter executes a sequence of instructions directly, where the format of the instructions is predetermined. 

## Notes
* Normally, an interpreter is used together with a tokenizer. However, this must not necessarily be the case. To keep the examples simple, I have deliberately dispensed with a tokeniser and instead simply defined a token sequence in an array.
