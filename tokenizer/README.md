# Tokenizer

## Intent
A tokenizer's primary purpose is to parse a given input text into a sequence of
meaningful units, called tokens. It identifies and separates tokens based on
predefined rules, such as delimiters or patterns. Tokenizers play a crucial role
in language processing tasks like compiling, interpreting, or natural language
processing.
